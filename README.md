# Pac-Man iOS Game

A SwiftUI implementation of the classic Pac-Man arcade game from the 1980s, written entirely by [Amazon Q Developers CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/command-line.html?trk=4b29643c-e00f-4ab6-ab9c-b1fb47aa1708&sc_channel=code).

**I haven't written a single line of code for this project.** Everything, I mean **everything** has been generated by Q Developers.

The list fo prompts and follow up question I asked is available in [Q-CLI-dialog.md](Q-CLI-dialog.md)
